# 5. Will an error occur if you try to access a list element with an index greater than or equal to the list's length? For example:

foo = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print(foo[3])

# Yes
# IndexError: list index out of range
# The last element in the list is indexed at length of list - 1; so in this case, the last element is indexed at 2

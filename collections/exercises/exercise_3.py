# 3. Identify at least 2 differences between lists and tuples. Identify at least 2 ways that lists and tuples are similar.

# 2 differences between lists & tuples
    # 1. lists are immutable & tuples are not
    # 2. tuples are immutable which means that they are hashable and lists are not  hashable
    # 3. lists use []; tuples use ()

# 2 similarities between list & tuples
    # 1. they are ordered sequences from which each element or object can accessed through index numbers
    # 2. they both are heterogeneous - meaning they can have different types of objects as elements which means they can have collections as elements as well

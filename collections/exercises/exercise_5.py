# 5. How do the set types differ from the sequence types?

# sets are unordered collection that only contain unique elements or members. 
# while a sequence can have duplicate values, when a duplicate value is added to a set, python will ignore the duplicate values
# when sequences are printed, they are printed in the order that the elements were assigned - with sets, the order is unpredictable

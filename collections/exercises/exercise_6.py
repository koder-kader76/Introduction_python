# 6. Assuming you have the following assignment:

pi = 3.141592

# Write some code that converts the value of pi to a string and assigns it to a variable named str_pi.

# use str constructor to produce a string type of the variable pi & assign it to str_pi
str_pi = str(pi)
# to view the actual type of the str_pi, use repr
print(repr(str_pi)) # '3.141592'

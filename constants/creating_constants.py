# CREATING CONSTANTS

# constants initialized the same way as variables
PINING_FOR = 'fjords'       # initialization

# notes about constants:
    # constants should never be re-assigned
    # usually defined in global scope - below the import statements
    # constants can be used in functions but never defined in functions

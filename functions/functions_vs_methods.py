# functions vs methods

# method invocation
    # prepend an obj with a (.) to a function invocation

my_str = 'abc-123-def'
print(my_str.upper())   # ABC-123-DEF

# methods
    # provide same benefits as functions
    # only work with specific objects 


# distinction between functions & methods
    # some function invocation look like method invocations

# e.g 
# import math
# print(math.sqrt(5))

# sole purpose of math object is to tell python where to look for those functions

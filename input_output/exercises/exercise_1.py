# 1. Write a program named greeter.py. The program should ask for your name, then output Hello, NAME! where NAME is the name you entered:

name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# 2 Modify the greeter.py program to ask for the user's first and last names separately, then greet the user with their full name.

first_name = input("What is your first name? ")
last_name = input("What is your last name? ")
print(f"Hello, {first_name} {last_name}!")

# creating & re-assigning variables

# initialize variable - assigning a value
forename = 'Clare'      # initialization
ultimate_question = 42

# re-assignment
forename = 'Victor'     # re-assignment
ultimate_question = 24

# a variable is defined when it is initialized
# no special keywords required

# how initialization & re-assignment work

# variable initialization
foo = 'abcdeghi'
    # initial value given by python
    # places value in computer's memory
    # allocates a small amount of memory to variable itself
    # places the value's memory addresss in the variable's spot in memory


# variable re-assignment
foo = 'Hello'
    # 'Hello' is created and placed in the computer's memory
    # since foo already exists, python replaces the variable's value memory to that of 'Hello'
    # so now the variable is pointing to a new value in its memory
